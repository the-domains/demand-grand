  My love for paper crafting wasn't always apparent. However, my passion to
  consistently live life operating at 110%, no matter how small or big the task,
  lives deep in my bones! Going above and beyond even when nobody is looking, is
  my favorite mantra. So is "work harder, play harder!" Because of this I truly
  enjoy hosting and trying to achieve a memorable experience for my guest, by
  creating personalized accents. After some years, Demand Grand was born- with
  much encouragement from my family and friends.    This passion of mine derives
  from 15 years in a customer driven industry (hospitality), where my daily goal
  was to find ways to provide customers with their requests, no matter how
  trivial or extravagant. Most recently, I worked overseas for the Air Force,
  which really provided me with a sense of integrity for my customers,
  throughout my work ethic.     After relocating to the states, my husband and I
  decided we would start a family, and my time at home was filled with lots of
  volunteer work throughout my community, to include the USO, Girl Scouts, PTO,
  etc., I truly enjoy hosting, although I've never been an "in-the-box" type of
  gal, so with more time on my hands than I've ever had (minus the fact that I
  have 2 kids under 2, and a 7 year old step-daughter), I found myself wanting
  to make my own invitations and party supplies, just so that they were unique
  and personalized.     Everyone has embraced my love for paper crafting and
  encouraged me to start my own business. I truly am a small business and hand
  make every tiny item that goes into my pieces. You can tell because they're
  all not identical. I'm hoping that my Etsy customers can appreciate the art of
  paper crafting and not mass produced products, because to me, the charm and
  character you receive from your custom piece, is priceless.    Thank you for
  visiting my page and I hope I can help you charm the pants off your guests,
  when you'll surely be, the host with the most! =)
